# Speech-to-text support for Galene

Galene-stt is an experiment in real-time speech-to-text (automatic
subtitling) for the [Galene][1] videoconferencing server.  Currently
Galene-stt simply dumps a transcript of the videoconference in the chat;
if the experiment is successful, we will extend the Galene protocol with
the ability to display subtitles.

Galene-stt connects to a Galene server using the same protocol as ordinary
clients.  Since Galene-stt requires a fair amount of CPU, this allows
running on a powerful local machine without the risk to overload the
server.
